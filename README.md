> The Tractor v2 Micro Frontends Sample using Piral with a Monorepo

:zap: A mono repository using Piral for micro frontends.

Feel free to play around with the code using StackBlitz.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/piral-samples/tractor-v2)

A micro frontends sample implementation of [The Tractor Store](https://micro-frontends.org/tractor-store/) built with Piral and React. It's based on the [Blueprint](https://github.com/neuland/tractor-store-blueprint).

**Live Demo:** [tractor-v2.samples.piral.cloud](https://tractor-v2.samples.piral.cloud/)

### Limitations

This implementation is deliberately kept simple to focus on the micro frontends aspects. URLs are hardcoded, components could be more DRY and no linting, testing or type-safety is implemented. In a real-world scenario, these aspects should be addressed properly.

### Performance

Several performance optimizations could still be applied, however, in the out-of-the-box state with three micro frontends and multiple components / pages included we'll end up with a lighthouse score of 100/100, which is great.

![Lighthouse Score](./lighthouse.png)

As a comparison a most lightweight SSR-only solution using the same codebase would be around 99/100. Another SPA sample that uses [Picard.js](https://picard.js.org/) with Native Federation ended up at 88/100. Hence, Piral gives optimal performance - no effort needed.

## How to run locally

### Installation

Clone this repository. Then use `lerna` to bootstrap the mono repo. Make sure to have `yarn` (v1) installed for this.

Run the following command inside the repository:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Running the Code

Now you can run all micro frontends (so-called pilets):

```sh
yarn start
```

This is an alias for `yarn watch:all`.

Open http://localhost:1234 in your browser to see the integrated application.

Alternatively, run only a single pilet (e.g., the `checkout-pilet`):

```sh
name=checkout yarn watch:mf
```

Or if you wan to, you can also run the app shell in isolation:

```sh
yarn watch:app
```
